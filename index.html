        <p>Male vs female coach salaries in the NCAA, especially basketball are monumentally different. Over the last year LSU women's basketball, lead by head coach Kim Mulkey, has made history. This team, with star player Angel Reese, have blown up the internet. This basketball phenom has brought a whole new community to women's college basketball. Tickets for these games were flying off of the shelf last season and they are a team that everyone wants to go and see. The increased ticket price this season did not keep away any fans and this season the LSU women's basketball team has sold out all season tickets. 
</p>
        <p>After their NCAA Championship win last season, Kim Mulkey's salary has increased drastically. Mulkey, having been ranked number three in highest paid coaches in women's NCAA basketball last season, is now at number one surpassing Geno Auriemma by $300,000. Mullkey made history as the highest-paid coach in NCAA women’s basketball.

        <p>Though there have been incremental salary increases for female basketball coaches, male basketball coaches hold the majority in the top 15 highest paid coaches in women’s basketball. 
</p>
        <p>Though history was made by Kim Mullkey, her salary doesn't even compare to the top 25 highest paid head coaches in men’s NCAA basketball. Kim Mullkey sits below number 25 Kenny Payne of Louisville. Payne is in his second season at Louisville after finishing last season 4-28 and the team not winning an NCAA championship since 1986. Mullkey, on the other hand, is coming off of a championship win and is still paid less.

        <p>Many can argue that revenue of these teams plays a large role in head coach salaries
