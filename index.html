        <p>Male vs female coach salaries in the NCAA, especially basketball are monumentally different. Over the last year LSU women's basketball, lead by head coach Kim Mulkey, has made history. This team, with star player Angel Reese, have blown up the internet. This basketball phenom has brought a whole new community to women's college basketball. Tickets for these games were flying off of the shelf last season and they are a team that everyone wants to go and see. The increased ticket price this season did not keep away any fans and this season the LSU women's basketball team has sold out all season tickets. </p>

        <p>After their NCAA Championship win last season, Kim Mulkey's salary has increased drastically. Mulkey, having been ranked number three in highest paid coaches in women's NCAA basketball last season, is now at number one surpassing Geno Auriemma by $300,000. Mullkey made history as the highest-paid coach in NCAA women’s basketball.</p>

        <p>Though there have been incremental salary increases for female basketball coaches, male basketball coaches hold the majority in the top 15 highest paid coaches in women’s basketball. </p>

        <p>Though history was made by Kim Mullkey, her salary doesn't even compare to the top 25 highest paid head coaches in men’s NCAA basketball. Kim Mullkey sits below number 25 Kenny Payne of Louisville. Payne is in his second season at Louisville after finishing last season 4-28 and the team not winning an NCAA championship since 1986. Mullkey, on the other hand, is coming off of a championship win and is still paid less.</p>

 <p>Many can argue that revenue of these teams plays a large role in head coach salaries, but many of women’s programs do not bring in any ticket sale revenue at all. For certain universities you only need to pay for the high revenue sports like football and men’s basketball, especially for students. If universities started charging for entry, then they may be able to allocate those funds towards the head coach salaries. </p>
        
<p> Sydney Staples, a former Lehigh Women’s Soccer player, feels as though if there wasn’t free admission to certain sporting events then those teams could gain more revenue. She, as many others have, realized that certain coaches are getting “NIL”esque deals like Coach Prime and Coach Saban. These two football head coaches have been featured in recent Aflec commercials. Though this may not add to their salary that they get from their prospective universities, it does affect their income. </p>

<p> As a female soccer player, Staples had a male head coach through her years at Lehigh. Because her team wasn’t a high revenue sport, her and her teammates had to do a lot of fundraising and relied heavily on alumni donations. While she was playing she didn't really know where those funds went. Through all four of her years on the Lehigh team, they had to fight to get winter parkas which they finally received in her final season, but then had to return at the end of the year. She believes that when you have a female head coach of a female team it is more beneficial for the players because they feel better understood and represented.</p>

<p>After graduating, Lehigh replaced the women’s soccer head coach with a woman. Staples observed that when  Lauren Calabrese became the head coach she advocated for the team to use their funds from alumni to go towards more tangible items like whoops and lululemon gear.</p>

<p>Staples also believes that when you have a female head coach they take into account when their players may prefer. She feels as though they take into account what the players may prefer off of the field like food options and locker room amenities. When you have a female head coach they have a better grip on what a female athlete would value. </p>
